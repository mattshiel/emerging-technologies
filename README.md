# Emerging Technologies

## Author: Matthew Shiel 

## Student ID: G00338622

This is my implementation of an Eliza chatbot in Go, based on the Eliza natural language processing program. This repository contains my project for my 4th year Emerging Technologies module in GMIT.

**Repository Contents:**

1. **NumPy Jupyter Notebook:** a jupyter notebook explaining the con- cepts behind and the use of the numpy random package, including plots of the various distributions.

2. **Iris Dataset Jupyter Notebook:** a jupyter notebook explaining the famous iris data set including the difficulty in writing an algorithm to separate the three classes of iris based on the variables in the dataset.

3. **MNIST dataset notebook:** a jupyter notebook explaining how to read the MNIST dataset efficiently into memory in Python.

4. **Digit recognition script:** a Python script that takes an image file containing a handwritten digit and identifies the digit using a super- vised learning algorithm and the MNIST dataset.

## Prerequisites 

*To run and view the .ipynb files, Jupyter Notebook/Jupyter lab and Python 2.7 must be installed on your machine:*

> Download Python and Jupyter Notebook:

Anaconda is an easy way to get both in a single distribution:
https://www.anaconda.com/download/

With Anaconda and Python installed, execute the following

    conda install jupyter 


With Juypter successfully installed , you can now download and run .ipynb files.

## How to Run The Jupyter Notebooks

*Assumes that Git is installed along with the prerequisites.*
*If not, it can be downloaded from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads)*

**1. Clone the Repository**
```bash
> git clone https://github.com/mattshiel/emerging-technologies.git
```

**2. Change Directory to the Folder**

```bash
Open the terminal/command line and navigate into the folder 
> cd emerging-technologies
```

**3. Run the Notebook**

```bash
> jupyter notebook $the_notebook_of_your_choice.ipynb
```

**4. Open the localhost**
```bash
If your browser does not open automatically, connect to the localhost specified in your terminal:
> http://localhost:8888/
```

## How to Run The Python Script

**1. Open the Terminal and Run:**
```bash
> python digitrec.py
```
