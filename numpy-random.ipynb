    "# The NumPy Package\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is it?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy is a Python package used for scientific computing. Often cited as a fundamental package in this area, this is for good reason. It provides a high performance multidimensional array object, and a variety of routines for operations on arrays. NumPy is not part of a basic Python installation. It has to be installed after the Python installation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implemented multi-dimensional arrays are very efficient as NumPy was mostly written in C; the precompiled mathematical and numerical functions and functionalities of NumPy guarantee excellent execution speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "At its core NumPy provides the ndarray (multidimensional/n-dimensional array) object. This is a grid of values of the same type indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. This is explained in further detail in the basics section below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Basics\n",
    "\n",
    "In Numpy, axes are called dimensions, lets take a hypothetical set of coordinates and see what exactly this means.\n",
    "\n",
    "The coordinates of a point in 3D space [1, 4, 5] has one axis that contains 3 elements ie. has a length of 3.\n",
    "Let's take another example to reinforce this idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the illustrated graph below we can see that the set of coordinates has 2 axes. Axis 1 has a length (shown in colour) of 2, and axis 2 has a length of 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "<mark>FIGURE 1</mark>\n",
    "![Graph displaying axes of coordinate](./images/pointInSpace.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of NumPy's most powerful features is it's array class: ```ndarray``` This is not to be confused with the Python's array class ```array.array``` which has less functionality and only handles one-dimensional arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Let's use some of ndarray's functions to prove and reinforce what we learnt above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Simple Example\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we use NumPy we have to import it.\n",
    "It is very common to see NumPy renamed to \"np\".\n",
    "\n"
