    "At it's basics, NumPy is a Python package used for scientific computing. Often cited as a fundamental package in this area, this is for good reason. As per the official NumPy documentation, Numpy \"provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more.\"\n"
